**Devlog**

4th August:
> Wrote a code that turns a led on and off based on the distance reading of an object.
> The code needs update where the led is turned on only if the object is infront of the sensor more than a given amount of time.
> Wired out a part of the circuit diagram, all components are good.
> Execution failed due to rusted wires.
> Need to buy the following:
1. Jumper Wires
2. AC DC converter
3. Enameled Copper Wire
4. Magnets
5. Heat Shrink Tube
6. 16 gauge connecting wire

8th August:
> Made some changes to the code
> Jotted down action sequence for cleaning the pan
> Ordered new Jumper wire
> Will get a AC DC converter tomorrow
> The calculations for induction coil needs to be done yet.

12th August:
> The Circuit design is nearly finalized.
> Inexperience with hardware have withheld my project.
> My board was short due to lack of earthing.
> Will have to work on 9V battery from now on.
> A PIR sensor is recommended now, it is cheap and easy to use.
> Using a makeshift one is also possible.
> Couldn’t use relay due to inexperience.
> Am trying to make meaning out of it.

21st August:
> The relay doesn’t work.
> Need to buy a new relay.
> GitHub Repo for project created
