# Auto Toilet Flush System or ATFS

**PROJECT OBJECTIVE**
>     To build a prototype of an automatic toilet flushing system for the Indian Ecosystem. 
> Thus providing the safety of contactless toilet amidst the COVID19
> pandemic. The project employs an Arduino UNO to sense the presence of an individual, further 
> counts the seconds of presence to confirm that the toilet is in use. An electromagnetic flush
> mount is used to pull up when required and the tank is full.
